# Mac Development Ansible Playbook

This playbook installs and configures most of the software I use on my Mac for web and software development.

This playbook will be updated throughout my life with various features, functions and roles - but they will always convey the same purpose.

## Installation

  Run the following from the command line, and enter your administrative password when requested.
  
  Note that initially you'll need to install xcode command line tools before you can proceed.
  
  1. `xcode-select --install`
  
  2. `chown root:admin /usr/local/`
  
  3. `chmod 775 /usr/local`
  
  4. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulianBour/mac-dev-playbook/master/install.sh | bash`
